# **Pulse AI: End-to-End Multimodal Healthcare Platform**

A production-ready application demonstrating a complete **MLOps lifecycle** for preliminary medical diagnostics and data analysis.

---

##  Project Overview

Pulse AI successfully integrates multiple state-of-the-art AI technologies into a single, cohesive web platform. The core achievement is moving three complex, data-intensive models into a single, efficient, and automated cloud environment.

### Key Achievements

| Feature | Technology & Contribution | MLOps Practice Demonstrated |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Symptom Checker (ML)** | LightGBM classifier with **92% accuracy** . | **Data Preprocessing Pipelines** (`joblib`, `ColumnTransformer`) for clean real-time inference. |
| **Image Analyzer (DL)** | TensorFlow CNN for X-ray analysis | **Model Optimization & Efficiency** |
| **AI Medical Assistant** | **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using **Gemini** and **LangChain** / **Pinecone** vector store. | **LLM Grounding** and using **Vector Databases** for private knowledge. |
| **Report Summarizer** | AI-powered medical report summarization using **Gemini LLM** to extract key insights from user-provided medical documents. | **Natural Language Processing** and **Document Understanding** for clinical text analysis. |
| **Data Analytics** | Live monitoring dashboard visualizing **real-time prediction trends** and **top 5 user queries** (via Chart.js). Integrated Tableau dashboard for comprehensive dataset overview and exploratory data analysis. | **Data Logging & Monitoring** of operational metrics. |

##  MLOps & Deployment Pipeline

The entire backend deployment is automated to ensure reliability, maintainability, and quick iteration.

### **1. CI/CD Workflow (GitHub Actions)**

The pipeline is triggered on every `git push` to the main branch and performs the following sequence:

1. **Code Quality Check:** Runs `black` and `ruff` checks.
2. **Unit Testing:** Executes **`pytest`** to validate all API endpoints for the Symptom Checker, Image Analyzer, and AI Assistant.
3. **Containerization:** Builds a new, optimized **Docker** image (using a minimal base image).
4. **Deployment:** Securely connects via SSH to the **AWS EC2** instance, pulls the new image from **Amazon ECR**, and restarts the container with zero downtime.

### **2. Security & Artifact Management**

* **Model Versioning:** Large model files (`.h5`, `.joblib`) are stored and managed using **Git LFS** (Large File Storage) to keep the main repository clean and fast.
* **Decoupled Architecture:** The application uses a separated backend (FastAPI/Docker on AWS) and a frontend (HTML/JS on Vercel) for better scalability and flexibility.

---

##  Getting Started (Local Setup)

To run the full backend and frontend on your machine:

### **Prerequisites**

* Python 3.10+
* Docker Desktop (Installed and Running)
* AWS CLI (Installed and Configured)
* Gemini and Pinecone API Keys

### **Installation & Execution**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuhammadAkmal03/HealthCareProject
cd HealthCareProject
```

2. **Create/Update `.env`:** Add your secret API keys to a file named `.env` in the root directory.

3. **Build the Docker Image:**

```bash
docker build -t pulse-ai-api .
```

4. **Run the Container:**

```bash
docker run -d --name pulse-ai-local -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env pulse-ai-api
```

* **Access API Docs:** `http://localhost:8000/docs`
* **Access Frontend:** Open the `frontend/index.html` file in your browser.
